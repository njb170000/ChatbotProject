Nov 14 22:30:11.800 2021 Respond: user:noah bot:harry len:14 ip: (~helper) 1 You are SMART  ==> Quite true. If you're not familiar with kpop or SM Entertainment, try asking me about them. If you want to talk about a specific group, but don't know the name, you can ask me what groups are in SM. You can also ask me for facts about any group or member in SM; facts are my specialty. I can also give you a few recommendations if you would rather start there. I am also able to remember your favorite group! Just tell me "(group) is my favorite group" and I will be sure to ask about it next time we talk. Finally, if you can't remember who's from where, just ask me! I can tell you all the members of a group, or which group a specific person is from. If you ever need to see this message again, just type "You are SMART." I will also respond to "help," but that one is a lot less fun, don't you think?  When:Nov 14 22:30:11.807 2021 7ms 0wait Why:~helper.0.0.~control.9.0  JOpen:0/0

Nov 14 22:30:32.476 2021 Respond: user:noah bot:harry len:25 ip: (~sm) 2 tell me about SM, please  ==> SM Entertainment started out as just a music company, but these days they do almost everything. Their talent is active in music, acting, reality shows, and much more. The company is always looking to the future, as well, investing in new technologies, markets, and ideas in an effort to bring the future of entertainment to their customers. The company also has a warmer, family-oriented tone than a lot of rival companies. With their signature pink color and teddy bear mascot, SM have mastered appealing to a wide audience with their image and music.
