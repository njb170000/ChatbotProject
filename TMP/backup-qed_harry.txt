 Welcome to ChatScript. anyeong
 Have you heard of SM's latest girl group, Aespa?
 You should definitely check them out if you like music that is a bit experimental. I'm a big fan of Giselle, their main rapper. Want to hear more about her?
 Oh, ok... How about a different topic then?
 Have you been here before?
 Welcome back!
